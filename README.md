# Project Euler
These are a collection of my attempts at project euler problems written in Go. I included a buildspec.yml which allows testing in CodeBuild on AWS, however just copy the build commands and run those in your terminal to build and run all the projects. 

I included execution time of main() as well as the answer as the output for each project
